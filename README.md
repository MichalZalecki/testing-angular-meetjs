# Testing AngularJS

Hi! This repo was created as a background for my meet.js Wroc≈Çaw presentation about testing AngularJS apps. In this project you can find sample components like a service which uses `$http`, directive, filter, couple partials and controller. Every component is covered with unit tests. Also you can find spec for E2E tests which will give you an overview what E2E tests are.

This project was build on top of [anguloffee](https://github.com/MichalZalecki/anguloffee). It's AngularJS with CoffeeScript starter which I recommend and use by myself.
